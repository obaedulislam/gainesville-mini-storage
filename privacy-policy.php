So that you understand our policies and your options, we have prepared this policy to explain what information we gather about you when you visit our website and related platforms, how we use it, and the safeguards we have in place to protect it. This policy may be updated from time to time, so check periodically for changes.</p>

            <h6 class="title-margin">Information Collected by Gainesville Mini Storage</h6>
            <p class="common-margin"><span class="fw-bold">GENERAL INFORMATION:</span> We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses and billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We may also request information about your self storage unit rental preferences. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general most of the information we request from you is required in order for you reserve a self storage unit, sign up for a discount, participate in a survey or contest, ask us a question, or initiate other transactions on our website.</p>
            <p class="mt-2"><span class="fw-bold">PROXY INFORMATION:</span>  When you make a reservation for someone else through this website, we will request personal information and self storage unit rental preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and rental preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.</p>
            <p class="mt-2"><span class="fw-bold">INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES:</span>  We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history, and demographic information.</p>
            <p class="mt-2"><span class="fw-bold">AUTOMATIC INFORMATION:</span> We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit this website. For example, we will collect your IP address, web browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as units viewed and buttons clicked. Our goals in collecting this automatic information include helping customize your user experience and inhibiting fraud.</p>

We create a digital audio recording of incoming telephone calls which may then be played, replayed, transcribed, monitored, analyzed and archived by employees, contractors, officers, agents, authorized representatives or other trusted third parties of Gainesville Mini Storage. Content may include, without limitation, personal and non-personal data related to such calls.</p>
